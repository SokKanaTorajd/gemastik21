We conducted research on the topic of cryptocurrency in Indonesia which was discussed on social media twitter.
The goal is to determine what sub-topics are discussed from the tweet data that has been collected.
Then by using LDA (latent dichellet allocation) for topic modeling and continued by doing a text network on each of the resulting sub-topics.
